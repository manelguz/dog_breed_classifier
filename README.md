# dog_breed_classifier
The project aims to build a dog breed classifier which aims to distinguish between 133 different dog's breed.

It is used two different approaches. A first Convolutional Neural Network built from scratch and a Vgg16 pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and modified for increasing the performance.

Additionally, it is added a human detector. It will match your photo to the dog breed that is more close to you.
